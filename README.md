The first step taken was creating a schema through QBD. This allowed us to set up and visualize the relationships that exist between the tables we would be making.

We imported our schema into PGAdmin and the CSV files. 
After importing the data from the CSV files, we created tables and performed joins and other functions to identify things. Such as employees with the name Hercules whose last name starts with B and creating a table that identifies the most common last names.
